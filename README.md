**Title:** Predicting Pneumonia using Convolutional Neural Network

**1. Problem Formulation:**

Our Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

Our Aim: To create a model that acts as the first layer when screening patients for Pneumonia. Only when the model preducts that the patient has Pneumonia, then the radiologists will take a look at the X-rays to confirm whether they have Pneumonia or not. This will greatly reduce the amount of X-rays that each radiologist would have to look through and can reduce the number of errors they make. Research has shown that after...

**2. Data Preparation and Cleaning:**

We prepared and cleaned our data in order to ensure that allows for further processing and analysis of the image data in Python. We also performed some changed to the image data which we thought might affect the robustness of our model (Augmented our image data to ensure that there is balanced data in our training data).

**3. Training our Model:**
